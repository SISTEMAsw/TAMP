The TAMP project has the main scope of implementing a system that allows its users (mainly belonging to the science community) to access and exploit a virtual working environment in the field of atmospheric sciences with the aim to improve satellite atmospheric composition algorithms. 
The main purpose of the TAMP environment is to allow performing validation and verification activities, comparing satellite / retrieved information with model data and ground-truth information. Moreover, data processing capabilities are provided to combine data, create new collections and verify their accuracy.
